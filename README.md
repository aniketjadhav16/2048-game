# 2048 Game

## Description
2048 is a popular single-player sliding block puzzle game. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

This project is a simple implementation of the 2048 game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to slide tiles in the corresponding direction.
